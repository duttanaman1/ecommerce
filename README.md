# ecommerce
The project is coded in php and mysql. I have used xampp server to run the project.
The snapshots of the project is included in <i>Readme</i> img folder.

## Running the project
<ul>
<li>I prefer using <i>xampp server</i> to run the project.</li>
<li>Change the master file name to <b><i>ecommerce</i></b> !Important. </li>
<li>Import the sql file to phpmyadmin with database name <b><i>'ecommerce'</i></b></li>

<li>In <i>connect.php</i>, I have connected to mysql server with username as <i>'root'</i> and blank password. Make suitable changes to <i>connect.php</i> according to your system.</li>
<li>All of the form post submission goes to files with name beginning with <i>'sql'</i>. This is the simple to decode the flow of the project. </li>
<li>There might be some small error occured because of change in system, debug them. It isn't hard</li>
</ul>
